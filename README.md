This projects aims to develop an application to control quadcopters using the Intel Edison Platform.
The control unit is based on an Intel Edison connected to Sparkfun peripheral blocks :
 - [SparkFun Block for Intel速 Edison - PWM](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13042) for ESCs control
 - [SparkFun Block for Intel速 Edison - 9 Degrees of Freedom](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13033) for orientation
 - [SparkFun Block for Intel速 Edison - Console](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13039) for debug and power supply regulator
 - [SparkFun Block for Intel速 Edison - GPIO](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13038) for UART communication to RF module
 
The RF module used is an [XBEE-ZB Pro](http://www.digi.com/products/wireless-wired-embedded-solutions/zigbee-rf-modules/zigbee-mesh-module/xbee-zb-module#overview) module for 2.4GHz long range communication. A custom protocol is implemented in the library.
